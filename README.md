# NanoGPT-like Language Model on Shakespeare

This repository contains a minimal implementation of a GPT-style language model (inspired by NanoGPT) trained on the complete works of Shakespeare. It demonstrates key transformer components such as self-attention, multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, residual connections, and layer normalization using PyTorch.

## Features

- **Custom Transformer Implementation:** Built from scratch without high-level frameworks.
- **Training on Shakespeare:** Learn language patterns from Shakespeare’s complete works.
- **Hyperparameter Flexibility:** Easily modify key hyperparameters for experimentation.
- **Text Generation:** Generate Shakespeare-style text after training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (tested with version 1.9+)
- (Optional) GPU support or the MPS backend (for Mac M1 users)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/nanogpt-shakespeare.git
   cd nanogpt-shakespeare
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install torch
   ```

   *Note: Mac M1 users can use the MPS backend by ensuring your PyTorch installation supports it.*

## Usage

### Training the Model

The main script is `bigram.py`, which contains the model definition and training loop. To start training, run:

```bash
python bigram.py
```

The script will:
- Load `input.txt` (the complete works of Shakespeare).
- Tokenize the text.
- Build and train the transformer model.
- Print training and validation loss at intervals defined by `eval_interval`.

### Hyperparameters

Key hyperparameters in `bigram.py` include:

- **batch_size:** `4` (use `32` for full-scale training if hardware permits)
- **block_size:** `128` (set to `256` for longer sequences)
- **max_iters:** Total training iterations (currently `5000`)
- **eval_interval:** Interval for evaluation (currently `500`)
- **lr:** Learning rate (`3e-4`)
- **n_embd:** Embedding dimension (`128` for this run; use `384` for full-scale training)
- **n_head:** Number of attention heads (`6`)
- **n_layer:** Number of transformer layers (`6`)
- **dropout:** Dropout rate (`0.2`)

### Text Generation

After training, you can generate text using the model’s `generate` method. The script includes an example that initializes a context token and generates 500 new tokens:

```python
context = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long, device=device)
generated_text = decode(model.generate(context, max_token_len=500)[0].tolist())
print(generated_text)
```

## Model Architecture

- **Embeddings:**  
  - *Token Embedding:* Maps token IDs to embedding vectors.
  - *Positional Embedding:* Adds positional information to each token.

- **Transformer Blocks:**  
  Each block includes:
  - *Multi-Head Self-Attention:* Processes the sequence in parallel via multiple attention heads.
  - *Feed-Forward Network:* Applies a non-linear transformation to each token.
  - *Residual Connections & Layer Normalization:* Help stabilize training and ensure smooth gradient flow.

- **Language Model Head:**  
  A final linear layer maps the output embeddings to vocabulary logits for next-token prediction.

## Troubleshooting on Mac

If you encounter memory issues on your Mac (especially on an M1):

- **Use the MPS Backend:**  
  Modify the device selection in `bigram.py`:
  ```python
  device = "mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu"
  ```
- **Reduce Model Size:**  
  Lower `batch_size`, `block_size`, `n_embd`, or `n_layer` if necessary.
- **Gradient Accumulation:**  
  Consider accumulating gradients over multiple mini-batches to simulate a larger effective batch size.
